README for ELECTRE v0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ELECTRE is a family of methods. This software currently supports ELECTRE
III and ELECTRE TRI, but we don't support graph-like output for ELECTRE
III. This software is for further development, and should not be used in
real-life cases yet.

REQUIREMENTS 
------------ 
With unix systems ELECTRE can be compiled by
running 'make'. The compilation requires Gnu scientific library
(libgsl). The program has been tested on Debian GNU/Linux and Macintosh
OS X 10.3.

The program probably can be compiled also for windows by using CYGWIN.

USAGE
-----
ELECTRE III:
Run ./electre datafile
The datafile can be given as an argument, or optionally the input can be piped to the program.
For the format of the datafile, see DATAEXAMPLE.
ELECTRE TRI:
Run ./electre_tri rule lambda [input_file]
where rule=[0/1], 0=pessimistic, 1=optimistic,
and lambda is the cutting level.
For the format of the datafile, see DATAEXAMPLE.TRI
